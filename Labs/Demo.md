### Screencast

Prepare a screencast for your final project. Try to keep your video under 5 minutes in length.
This video will be shown in your lab. After playing your video, you will spend a few minutes answering audience and TA questions.
Include a link to your video in your repo/wiki.

Consider investing extra time in making this video -- students often find that they will be asked to provide some examples of previous work or 
other times I will be asked to provide a reference for a student's work. 
A good screencast is an excellent way to accomplish that. 
Further, it is a useful skill to have when doing little demos within a company or
when making your own tools or products public.

### Content

* You primarily want to illustrate the use cases you have implemented.
* Highlight any interesting user experience or technology choices you made.
* If you implemented the extra engineering extra credit, this is a great thing to highlight.
* Describe your overall design approach and any other relevant decisions you made.
