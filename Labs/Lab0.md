# Lab: iTrust InstallFest

Bring a laptop with you. If you would like to speed up the Install Fest, download all of the technologies that you will need for iTrust. Allow some time for this. For example, the Eclipse download can take 20-30 minutes depending on your connection speed.

Please remember to sign the attendance sheet.

#### iTrust (40 minutes)

iTrust is an online medical records system that we will be maintaining and enhancing over the course of the semester. iTrust is a medium size application that goes beyond a basic Java program and includes JSPs, databases, and other technologies. Information about iTrust may be found at: http://agile.csc.ncsu.edu/iTrust/wiki/doku.php.

During the semester, we will be using Eclipse to develop iTrust. Eclipse is an open-source integrated development environment (IDE). Eclipse can be enhanced by installing plug-ins that can help you with your development of iTrust. Additionally, you will need to install a local Tomcat server and database to help with development of iTrust. There are instructions for setting up a development enviornment for iTrust [in the lab](http://agile.csc.ncsu.edu/iTrust/wiki/doku.php?id=lab_deployment_instructions) and [on a personal computer](http://agile.csc.ncsu.edu/iTrust/wiki/doku.php?id=home_deployment_instructions) (like a laptop).

Take the time remaining in lab to start installing iTrust on either the lab machine (as practice for setting everything up at home) or on your laptop. Your TA and classmates will be available to answer questions about the installation during this time.

#### HW1.P1 (30 minutes)

Spend the remaining time getting started on [HW1.P1](https://github.com/CSC-326/HW1.P1).
